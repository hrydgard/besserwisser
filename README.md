============

A simple implementation of deep neural networks. Made this in order to understand them better.

For production use, you're probably better of with something like Caffe or Keras.

Features working:

  * Load MNIST data set
  * Mini-batch training
  * Multi-layer (fully connected) neural networks
  * RELU and Sigmoid activation functions (RELU recommended)
  * AVX acceleration of nearly all functionality
  * SVM and Softmax loss functions
  * Inference

Future plans:

  * Convolutional nets
  * API and a workable command line/config file user interface
  * GPU training and inference using Vulkan
  * Multi-threaded CPU training

To run the example, first run get-mnist.sh to get the MNIST dataset (or download it manually). If you're on Windows, get-mnist.sh will run under WSL. Also make sure to run ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` before building.

To build and run on Windows:

  * With VS2017, use File->Open Folder to open as a CMake project.
  * Choose x64-Release and to the right of that make sure to choose the right output to run.
  * Ctrl+F5

To build on other platforms:

  * ```cmake .```
  * make
